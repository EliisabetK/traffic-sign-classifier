4/15/2025 9:43:05,Agree,Agree,,Easier than previous assignments,Agree,2-5 hours,Agree,No,Agree,"Most difficult part was making modifications to images.
Instructions how to calculste fi score for modified images, It was't hard to figure out, but at first I did it wrong.
I would recommend keeping it. Was fun for me. "
4/15/2025 9:50:56,Agree,Agree,"Environment setup (Python, Java) was confusing, Techinal setup instructions were lacking, Too much information at once, Didn't understand how to apply metamorphic testing",Slightly more difficult than previous assignments,Somewhat disagree,2-5 hours,Somewhat disagree,Yes,Agree,Yes keep definately. 
4/15/2025 10:01:20,Agree,Agree,,About the same difficulty,Agree,2-5 hours,Agree,Yes,Somewhat agree,"I think this lab was good and it should be definitely kept in future versions of the course. Tasks were easily understandable, examples were useful and completing the lab was actually interesting."
4/15/2025 10:13:02,Agree,Somewhat disagree,"Environment setup (Python, Java) was confusing",About the same difficulty,Somewhat disagree,2-5 hours,Agree,Yes,Somewhat agree,"First task was very easy and didn't take me a lot of time. But the second tasks setup was a little messy.  I tried to follow these orders: (If you have any issues, the following versions are known to work without compatibility problems: Tensorflow version 2.18.0, Numpy 2.2.1, Pandas 2.2.3, Matplotlib 3.10.0, Scikit-learn 1.6.1, Scipy 1.15.1, Pillow 11.1.0) but for me these didn't work and frankly I don't remember how I got this to work, but the task itself was fun. I liked the tasks scenarios, I think these made the tasks more interesting. "

I would make both tasks in java/javascript. I would never recommend broken lab to anyone but my enemies.
4/15/2025 10:23:33,Agree,Somewhat agree,"Environment setup (Python, Java) was confusing, Techinal setup instructions were lacking",About the same difficulty,Somewhat agree,2-5 hours,Agree,Yes,Agree,"The most difficult part of the lab was setting up the environment, because there could be very many different reasons why the environment did not start at once. For example I had an issue with old Java version. Since we used outdated Java version in the previous lab, it should've been mentioned as one of the possible reasons for the environment set up issue."

4/15/2025 12:19:46,Agree,Agree,,Easier than previous assignments,Somewhat agree,2-5 hours,Agree,Yes,Somewhat agree,Would make guides to use the programs for updating images (eg rotating) rather than having us read a lot of documentation

4/15/2025 16:33:11,Agree,Agree,,Easier than previous assignments,Agree,2-5 hours,Agree,No,Agree,The most difficult part of this lab was experimenting with different modifications to assess how severe the weather conditions need to be in order to distinguish one model's robustness from another's

4/16/2025 12:19:28,Somewhat agree,Agree,,Easier than previous assignments,Disagree,Under 2 hours,Agree,No,Somewhat agree,I liked doing it because it was easy to understand and a change of pace for usual homeworks which i haven't enjoyed
4/16/2025 12:20:46,Agree,Somewhat agree,,About the same difficulty,Somewhat agree,2-5 hours,Somewhat agree,No,Somewhat agree,"I'd recommend keeping this lab in future versions of the course, because we got to edit pictures."

4/16/2025 12:21:26,Somewhat agree,Agree,Instructions were spread out or not easy to navigate,About the same difficulty,Somewhat agree,5-10 hours,Agree,Yes,Agree,"The setup and understanding tasks was the hardest. I would improve materials and explanations. Yes I would keep it in, solving these tasks was interesting."
4/16/2025 12:21:29,Agree,Agree,,About the same difficulty,Agree,2-5 hours,Somewhat agree,No,Somewhat agree,"Finding the bug concerning speed in one of the calculators was difficult with purely metamorphic testing.

I think it was a good practical, definitelly can keep it in"
4/16/2025 12:21:38,Agree,Somewhat agree,,Slightly more difficult than previous assignments,Somewhat disagree,5-10 hours,Somewhat disagree,No,Agree,"The most difficult part was understanding what and  how it should be done.  

Perhaps more  side  cases should be  discussed when describing the setup since the  whole lab was dedicated to fixing different setup errors.

Yes, I recommend, because it was a new and interesting branch of software testing that will definitely be useful in the future."
4/16/2025 12:21:48,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,"Instructions were spread out or not easy to navigate, Some instructions were hard to follow due to grammar or wording, Didn't understand how to apply metamorphic testing",Slightly more difficult than previous assignments,Agree,2-5 hours,Agree,Yes,Agree,"The most difficult part of the lab was analyzing the results of Task 2, I would make the lab document more compact and easier to track. I would recommend keeping this lab in future versions of this course, because after completing it I felt like I understood how testing really matters"
4/16/2025 12:22:32,Agree,Agree,,About the same difficulty,Agree,Under 2 hours,Agree,Yes,Agree,Materials and tasks were easy to follow and understandable. I would recommend keeping this lab.
4/16/2025 12:24:01,Agree,Somewhat agree,Techinal setup instructions were lacking,About the same difficulty,Somewhat agree,2-5 hours,Agree,Yes,Agree,"The most difficult part was implementing the image processing for the AI system test, thinking of the relations was actually quite fun and interesting.
There should be some kind of technical FAQ so that the common problems setting up the environment would be more easily solved. Maybe there could be some keywords or instructions how to analyse the models performance more in depth.
I would recommend keeping this lab, because AI and machine learning are becoming a bigger part of the software industry and this kind of testing doesn't seem to be covered in the data science courses. Seems like an actually useful topic."
4/16/2025 16:21:54,Agree,Agree,,About the same difficulty,Agree,2-5 hours,Agree,Yes,Agree,For me the instructions of the tasks were clearer and better than in any other homework.

4/17/2025 11:59:30,Agree,Agree,,Easier than previous assignments,Agree,2-5 hours,Somewhat agree,Yes,Somewhat agree,I would recommend this in future versions of the course because everyday AI is becoming more and more an actual topic.
4/17/2025 14:24:12,Agree,Agree,,Slightly more difficult than previous assignments,Agree,5-10 hours,Agree,Yes,Agree,"This lab felt closest to testing real world applications, not just toy programs."
